# IndianNLP
This is a framework that helps you with the Natural Language Processing tasks involving the languages spoken in the Indian sub-continent.

The list of sub-components would include:

##Javascript Library
  1. It would detect an Indian language based on the Unicode from the contents of a web page and convert it into another unicode based on user's choice.
  2. The library would have a component where it could read an image/video and infer the text present in it. This would help Indians who have smartphones but have poor network infrastructures/cannot afford expensive internet packs.

##Translation API
  1. The API would feature server side code that would accept requests for translation and convert the input to appropriate target language.

##Language Grammar
  The documentation of Language Grammar for the following language families:
  1. Indo-Aryan (Indic)
  2. Dravidian
  3. Iranian
  4. Nuristani
  5. Austro-Asiatic
  6. Indo-Chinese (Sino-Tibetan)
